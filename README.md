# snake-learning

A snake game for reinforcement learning.  I wanted to train a reinforcement
learning model, and while I was brainstorming data collection, I threw this game
together really quick.  While I never got around to training the model (some
day!), this game turned out really well!

## How to play

Run `./game/play_snake.py`.  Use your arrow keys to drive the snake.
